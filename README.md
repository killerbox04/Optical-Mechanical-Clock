# Optical-Mechanical-Clock
My 3rd year engineering master project. Consists of a wheel spinning at a constant rate with an small hole in it. Light from an LED passes through the hole and onto a photo-resistor on the other side. By knowing the distance from the center of the disk to the hole and the speed of the rotating disk, time can be determined.


# Other Notes: 
A "tick" is 1 detected spike in the photoresistor's value
